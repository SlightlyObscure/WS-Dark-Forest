-Case Info I
	The Hester family wants you to find their only daughter, who they presume to be missing.
	29 year old Evelyn Hester left New York some three weeks ago and has not been in contact with her parents since.
*bag & key sound*
-Case Info II
	An anthropologist, she'd come across rumours of unusual pagan practices, in a remote part of northern Pennsylvania.
	Apparently, less reputable sources mention heathan rituals and satanism. Sources, which the Hester family takes very seriously.
	She left for Tenebrook, Pennsylvania, on a field research trip that was only meant to take 2 weeks, according to her parents.
*coat & door sound*
-Case Info III
	Certainly, the recent string of dissappearances in the area isn't helping the Hesters keep a cool head.
	Why they've decided this is a matter for a P.I. and not the police is beyond you, but they're paying well, at least.
